# github action maven release

The GitHub Action for Maven releases wraps the Maven CLI to enable Maven release to be run by a bot.
You can use this action for auto-releasing your java artefacts each time you commit into master.

The release will allow you to setup a GPG key for your bot.

# Usage

## Maven release

For a simple repo with not much protection and private dependency, you can do:

```
 - name: Release
      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master
      with:
        release-branch-name: "master"

        git-release-bot-name: "release-bot"
        git-release-bot-email: "release-bot@example.com"

        access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```
You can add some maven options, which is handy for skipping tests:
```
        maven-args: "-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -DskipITs -Ddockerfile.skip -DdockerCompose.skip"
```
Or you can release and upload the artifacts to GitHub Packages repository and optionally upload docker image to docker registry:
```
- name: Release
        uses: mg-smartrent/github-actions-maven-release@v2.6
        with:
          release-branch-name: "master"
          git-release-bot-name: "ReleaseBot"
          git-release-bot-email: "release.bot@smartrent.com"
          access-token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}

          # Release
          maven-repo-server-id: ${MAVEN_SERVER_ID}
          maven-repo-server-username: ${GITHUB_USERNAME}
          maven-repo-server-password: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
          maven-release-args: "-Dskip.unit.tests=true -Dskip.integration.tests=true"

          # Publish artifacts to GitHub Packages
          maven-publish-args: "-Dskip.unit.tests=true -Dskip.integration.tests=true"
          maven-release-publish: "true"
          maven-snapshot-publish: "true"

          #Build and push Docker Image to docker registry
          maven-release-push-docker: "true"
          maven-snapshot-push-docker: "true"
          maven-docker-args: ""
          maven-docker-user: ${DOCKER_USERNAME}
          maven-docker-password: ${DOCKER_PASSWORD}
          maven-docker-file-repository: ${DOCKER_FILE_REPOSITORY}
``` 


If you want to setup a GPG key, you can do it by injecting your key via the secrets:

Note: `GITHUB_GPG_KEY` needs to be base64 encoded.
if you haven't setup a GPG key yet, see next section

```
 - name: Release
      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master
      with:
        release-branch-name: "master"
        gpg-enabled: "true"
        gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY_ID }}
        gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY }}

        git-release-bot-name: "release-bot"
        git-release-bot-email: "release-bot@example.com"

        access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```


If you got a private maven repo to setup in the settings.xml, you can do:
Note: we recommend putting those values in your repo secrets.

```
 - name: Release
      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master
      with:
        release-branch-name: "master"

        maven-repo-server-id: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}
        maven-repo-server-username: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}
        maven-repo-server-password: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_PASSWORD }}

        git-release-bot-name: "release-bot"
        git-release-bot-email: "release-bot@example.com"

        access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

Here is an example with all of the options at the same time:

```
 - name: Release
      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master
      with:
        release-branch-name: "master"

        gpg-enabled: "true"
        gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY_ID }}
        gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY }}

        maven-repo-server-id: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}
        maven-repo-server-username: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}
        maven-repo-server-password: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_PASSWORD }}

        maven-args: "-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -DskipITs -Ddockerfile.skip -DdockerCompose.skip"

        git-release-bot-name: "release-bot"
        git-release-bot-email: "release-bot@example.com"

        access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

We welcome contributions! If your usecase is slightly different than us, just suggest a RFE or contribute to this repo directly.

## Setup the bot gpg key

Setting up a gpg key for your bot is a good security feature. This way, you can enforce sign commits in your repo,
even for your release bot.

- Create dedicate github account for your bot and add him into your team for your git repo.
- Create a new GPG key: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key

This github action needs the key ID and the key base64 encoded.

```$xslt
        gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY_ID }}
        gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY }}
```

### Get the KID

You can get the key ID doing the following:

```$xslt
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG

sec   rsa2048/3EFC3104C0088B08 2019-11-28 [SC]
      CBFD9020DAC388A77C68385C3EFC3104C0088B08
uid                 [ultimate] bot-openbanking4-dev (it's the bot openbanking4.dev key) <bot@openbanking4.dev>
ssb   rsa2048/7D1523C9952204C1 2019-11-28 [E]

```
The key ID for my bot is 3EFC3104C0088B08. Add this value into your github secret for this repo, under `GITHUB_GPG_KEY_ID`
PS: the key id is not really a secret but we found more elegant to store it there than in plain text in the github action yml

### Get the GPG private key

Now we need the raw key and base64 encode
```$xslt
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor 3EFC3104C0088B08 | base64
```

Copy the result and add it in your github repo secrets under `GITHUB_GPG_KEY`.

Go the bot account in github and import this GPG key into its profile.
